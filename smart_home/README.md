# Smart home systems
This repository contains the code and documentation for a smart lightning system designed to automatically adjust room
lighting based on motion detection and ambient light intensity. 
Additionally, it features a manual mode for user control. It utilizes a PIR motion sensor, a
 relay module, and a light sensor (TEMT6000) for its functionality.

Installation & Usage
1. Hardware Setup: Connect the PIR motion sensor, relay module, and light sensor to the appropriate GPIO pins.
2. Software Installation: Clone or download the repository and upload the code to your microcontroller or development board.
3. Configuration: Adjust parameters like sensitivity levels and light intensity thresholds in the code.
Operating Modes:
	Automatic Mode: The system operates autonomously, adjusting lighting based on presence and ambient light.
	Manual Mode: Users can manually control the lighting system as needed.
4. Power On: Once installed, switch between automatic and manual modes as desired.
